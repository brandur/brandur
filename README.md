**Hi, I'm Brandur.**

I like databases, the independent web, and fast interfaces. I write in full sentences on Slack and use emoticons instead emoji. I think the modern web took a wrong turn on its evolutionary path and that we should resurrect ideas from the earlier days of computing — less centralization, software that's harder to learn but more powerful, and wider technical literacy.

My [personal website is here](https://brandur.org) and I'm on Twitter at [***@brandur***](https://twitter.com/brandur).

I'm a sometimes writer. Most frequently by publishing a newsletter called [**Nanoglyph**](https://brandur.org/newsletter#nanoglyph) (which you should sign up for :). Here are its latest issues:

* ⓝ [042 — Service Resumed](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/042-resumed) <sub><em>July 15, 2025</em></sub>
* ⓝ [041 — 15, 16](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/041-15-16) <sub><em>November 17, 2023</em></sub>

I put other stream of consciousness thoughts into tiny blog posts called [**fragments**](https://brandur.org/fragments):
