**Hi, I'm Brandur.**

I like databases, the independent web, and fast interfaces. I write in full sentences on Slack and use emoticons instead emoji. I think the modern web took a wrong turn on its evolutionary path and that we should resurrect ideas from the earlier days of computing — less centralization, software that's harder to learn but more powerful, and wider technical literacy.

My [personal website is here](https://brandur.org) and I'm on Twitter at [***@brandur***](https://twitter.com/brandur).

I'm a sometimes writer. Most frequently by publishing a newsletter called [**Nanoglyph**](https://brandur.org/newsletter#nanoglyph) (which you should sign up for :). Here are its latest issues:

* ⓝ [021 — Editors, IDEs; O Gods, What If Microsoft Was Right All Along?](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/021-ides) <sub><em>February 28, 2021</em></sub>
* ⓝ [020 — Alfred & the Zen of Tool Sharpening](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/020-alfred) <sub><em>February 21, 2021</em></sub>
* ⓝ [019 — Anatomy of a Great API Library](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/019-api-libraries) <sub><em>February 15, 2021</em></sub>

I put other stream of consciousness thoughts into tiny blog posts called [**fragments**](https://brandur.org/fragments):

* 🐚 [The Leica Q2 Monochrom, or why not to get into Leica](https://brandur.org/fragments/leica-q2-monochrom) <sub><em>February 20, 2021</em></sub>
* 🐚 [The girl next door](https://brandur.org/fragments/girl-next-door) <sub><em>February 20, 2021</em></sub>

Once in a while, I write longer form [**articles**](https://brandur.org/articles):
