**Hi, I'm Brandur.**

I like databases, the independent web, and fast interfaces. I write in full sentences on Slack and use emoticons instead emoji. I think the modern web took a wrong turn on its evolutionary path and that we should resurrect ideas from the earlier days of computing — less centralization, software that's harder to learn but more powerful, and wider technical literacy.

My [personal website is here](https://brandur.org) and I'm on Twitter at [***@brandur***](https://twitter.com/brandur).

I'm a sometimes writer. Most frequently by publishing a newsletter called [**Nanoglyph**](https://brandur.org/newsletter#nanoglyph) (which you should sign up for :). Here are its latest issues:

* ⓝ [017 — Twenty Years](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/017-twenty) <sub><em>January 6, 2021</em></sub>
* ⓝ [016 — Postgres 13, Shrunken Indexes, Planet Earth](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/016-postgres-13) <sub><em>October 26, 2020</em></sub>

I put other stream of consciousness thoughts into tiny blog posts called [**fragments**](https://brandur.org/fragments):

* 🐚 [Development log: Rescuing history](https://brandur.org/fragments/rescuing-history) <sub><em>January 8, 2021</em></sub>
* 🐚 [What to do in 2021](https://brandur.org/fragments/2021) <sub><em>January 3, 2021</em></sub>
