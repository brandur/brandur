**Hi, I'm Brandur.**

I like databases, the independent web, and fast interfaces. I write in full sentences on Slack and use emoticons instead emoji. I think the modern web took a wrong turn on its evolutionary path and that we should resurrect ideas from the earlier days of computing — less centralization, software that's harder to learn but more powerful, and wider technical literacy.

My [personal website is here](https://brandur.org) and I'm on Twitter at [***@brandur***](https://twitter.com/brandur).

I'm a sometimes writer. Most frequently by publishing a newsletter called [**Nanoglyph**](https://brandur.org/newsletter#nanoglyph) (which you should sign up for :). Here are its latest issues:

* ⓝ [019 — Anatomy of a Great API Library](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/019-api-libraries) <sub><em>February 15, 2021</em></sub>
* ⓝ [018 — Ruby 3's Ractors](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/018-ractors) <sub><em>January 15, 2021</em></sub>
* ⓝ [017 — Twenty Years](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/017-twenty) <sub><em>January 6, 2021</em></sub>

I put other stream of consciousness thoughts into tiny blog posts called [**fragments**](https://brandur.org/fragments):

* 🐚 [Predictions for San Francisco over two years](https://brandur.org/fragments/sf-two-years) <sub><em>February 15, 2021</em></sub>
* 🐚 [Engineering blog posts: Apply healthy skepticism](https://brandur.org/fragments/engineering-skepticism) <sub><em>February 12, 2021</em></sub>
* 🐚 [Blog with Markdown + Git, and degrade gracefully through time](https://brandur.org/fragments/graceful-degradation-time) <sub><em>February 8, 2021</em></sub>

Once in a while, I write longer form [**articles**](https://brandur.org/articles):
