**Hi, I'm Brandur.**

I like databases, the independent web, and fast interfaces. I write in full sentences on Slack and use emoticons instead emoji. I think the modern web took a wrong turn on its evolutionary path and that we should resurrect ideas from the earlier days of computing — less centralization, software that's harder to learn but more powerful, and wider technical literacy.

My [personal website is here](https://brandur.org) and I'm on Twitter at [***@brandur***](https://twitter.com/brandur).

I'm a sometimes writer. Most frequently by publishing a newsletter called [Nanoglyph](https://brandur.org/newsletter#nanoglyph) (which you should sign up for :). Here are its latest issues:

* ⓝ [013 — Remote; the Origins of Postgres](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/013-remote) <sub><em>August 11, 2020</em></sub>
* ⓝ [012 — Virtual Worlds](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/012-virtual-worlds) <sub><em>April 15, 2020</em></sub>
* ⓝ [011 — Sheltering, Twin Peaks; Asynchronous I/O, in Circles](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/011-shelter) <sub><em>March 27, 2020</em></sub>

I put other stream of consciousness thoughts into tiny blog posts called **fragments**:

* 🐚 [TTL indexes in Mongo](https://brandur.org/fragments/ttl-indexes) <sub><em>August 26, 2020</em></sub>
* 🐚 [Beginner Japanese](https://brandur.org/fragments/beginner-japanese) <sub><em>August 25, 2020</em></sub>
* 🐚 [Development log: Turning on DMARC for sending email](https://brandur.org/fragments/dmarc) <sub><em>August 19, 2020</em></sub>

Once in a while, I write longer form articles:

* 📖 [Doubling the Sorting Speed of Postgres Network Types with Abbreviated Keys](https://brandur.org/sortsupport-inet) <sub><em>August 2019</em></sub>
* 📖 [Sequences: A Modest, Contra-garden Travel Project](https://brandur.org/sequences-project) <sub><em>June 2019</em></sub>
* 📖 [Building a Robust Live Reloader with WebSockets and Go](https://brandur.org/live-reload) <sub><em>May 2019</em></sub>
