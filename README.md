**Hi, I'm Brandur.**

I like databases, the independent web, and fast interfaces. I write in full sentences on Slack and use emoticons instead emoji. I think the modern web took a wrong turn on its evolutionary path and that we should resurrect ideas from the earlier days of computing — less centralization, software that's harder to learn but more powerful, and wider technical literacy.

My [personal website is here](https://brandur.org) and I'm on Twitter at [***@brandur***](https://twitter.com/brandur).

I'm a sometimes writer. Most frequently by publishing a newsletter called [**Nanoglyph**](https://brandur.org/newsletter#nanoglyph) (which you should sign up for :). Here are its latest issues:

* ⓝ [033 — Heroku: Core Impact](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/033-heroku) <sub><em>May 10, 2022</em></sub>
* ⓝ [032 — Hook Toil](https://brandur.org/nanoglyphs/032-hook-toil) <sub><em>February 26, 2022</em></sub>

I put other stream of consciousness thoughts into tiny blog posts called [**fragments**](https://brandur.org/fragments):

* 🐚 [There's always an events table](https://brandur.org/fragments/events) <sub><em>May 1, 2022</em></sub>
* 🐚 [Sorbet + 100% cov makes Ruby refactoring possible](https://brandur.org/fragments/large-scale-ruby-refactoring) <sub><em>April 25, 2022</em></sub>

Once in a while, I write longer form [**articles**](https://brandur.org/articles):

* 📖 [Postgres: Boundless `text` and Back Again](https://brandur.org/text) <sub><em>September 10, 2021</em></sub>
* 📖 [How We Went All In on sqlc/pgx for Postgres + Go](https://brandur.org/sqlc) <sub><em>September 8, 2021</em></sub>
