**Hi, I'm Brandur.**

I like databases, the independent web, and fast interfaces. I write in full sentences on Slack and use emoticons instead emoji. I think the modern web took a wrong turn on its evolutionary path and that we should resurrect ideas from the earlier days of computing ‚Äî less centralization, software that's harder to learn but more powerful, and wider technical literacy.

My [personal website is here](https://brandur.org) and I'm on Twitter at [***@brandur***](https://twitter.com/brandur).

I'm a sometimes writer. Most frequently by publishing a newsletter called [**Nanoglyph**](https://brandur.org/newsletter#nanoglyph) (which you should sign up for :). Here are its latest issues:
{{range (slice .Nanoglyphs 0 3)}}
* ‚ìù [{{HTMLEscape .Title}}]({{.Link.Href}}) <sub><em>{{FormatTimeLocal .Published}}</em></sub>
{{- end}}

I put other stream of consciousness thoughts into tiny blog posts called [**fragments**](https://brandur.org/fragments):
{{range (slice .Fragments 0 3)}}
* üêö [{{HTMLEscape .Title}}]({{.Link.Href}}) <sub><em>{{FormatTimeLocal .Published}}</em></sub>
{{- end}}

Once in a while, I write longer form [**articles**](https://brandur.org/articles):
{{range (slice .Articles 0 3)}}
* üìñ [{{HTMLEscape .Title}}]({{.Link.Href}}) <sub><em>{{FormatTimeLocal .Published}}</em></sub>
{{- end}}

As often as I can, I post a daily photo and update to [**sequences**](https://brandur.org/sequences):
{{range (slice .Sequences 0 3)}}
* üì∑ [{{HTMLEscape .Title}}]({{.Link.Href}}) <sub><em>{{FormatTimeLocal .Published}}</em></sub>
{{- end}}
